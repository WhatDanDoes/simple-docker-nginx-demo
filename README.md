simple-docker-nginx-demo
========================

The simplest Docker Compose/NGINX demo I could cook up...

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/WhatDanDoes/simple-docker-nginx-demo.git
```

Change into the project directory:

```
cd simple-docker-nginx-demo
```

Boot up the composition:

```
docker-compose up
```

If you've deployed locally, you can see the _hello world_ webpage on http://localhost. If deployed on a LAN, enter the host machine's IP address into your favourite browser.
